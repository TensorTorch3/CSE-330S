# CSE-330S
These are the websites/individual assignments I made for CSE 330S

## Repository Structure

This repository contains multiple projects, including:

- Module 1
- Module 2 (Group & Individual)
- Module 3 (Group & Individual)
- Module 4
- Module 5 (Group & Individual)
- Module 6 (Group & Individual)
- Creative Project

## Git Workflow

To ensure changes are properly tracked and visible in the commits section, follow these steps:

1. Make your changes to any files within the repository (including subdirectories like Creative Project)
2. Stage the changes for commit:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
   Or to add specific files:
   ```
   git add path/to/file
   ```
3. Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```
4. Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push
   ```

### Important Note

Changes made to files in subdirectories (like Creative Project) will only appear in the commits section after they have been committed and pushed to the repository. Simply making changes to files without committing them will not make them visible in the commit history.
