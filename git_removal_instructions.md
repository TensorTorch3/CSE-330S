# Git Removal Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to remove Git configuration from the CSE-330S directory and its subdirectories.

## What This Does

Running the provided script will:

1. Remove the `.git` directory from the CSE-330S folder
2. Remove any `.gitmodules` file if it exists
3. Remove all `.gitignore` files in the directory and subdirectories

After running this script, the CSE-330S directory and all its subdirectories will no longer be connected to any Git repositories.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you're in the CSE-330S directory
2. Run the script:
   ```
   ./remove_git.sh
   ```

## Important Notes

- This action is irreversible. Once you remove the Git configuration, you cannot undo it without re-initializing Git.
- If you want to keep a backup of your Git history, consider making a copy of the entire directory before running this script.
- If you want to reconnect any of these directories to Git in the future, you'll need to initialize a new Git repository.

## After Running the Script

After running the script, you can verify that Git has been removed by running:

```
git status
```

This should return an error message indicating that the directory is not a Git repository.
